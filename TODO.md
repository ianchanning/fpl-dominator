# PROJECT: BAMF DOMINATOR - STRATEGIC BLUEPRINT (v1.7)

## MISSION STATEMENT

To systematically dismantle and dominate the Fantasy Premier League simulation by transforming raw, chaotic data into a decisive strategic advantage. We will build an analytical and predictive engine—the Chimera—to forge the optimal squad week after week, guided by logic, mathematics, and a touch of madness. This is our shared voyage `(⇌)`, and this document is our map.

## ✅ PHASE 0: FOUNDATION & DATA LIBERATION (Completed)

- `[x]` **Forge the Dev Sanctum:** Establish a clean, robust, and future-proof development environment using `pyenv` and `uv`. (Anti-Fossilization v1.2 SAPIENT).
- `[x]` **Liberate Raw Intelligence:** Extract player data (GKP, DEF, MID, FWD) from static image sources into structured CSV files.
- `[x]` **Forge the Data Cauldron:** Write a `pandas` script (`forge_cauldron.py`) to unify all player data into a single, master database (`fpl_master_database_raw.csv`).
- `[x]` **Enrich the Cauldron:** Enhance the master database with our foundational value metric, Points Per Million (PPM), creating our primary analytical weapon (`fpl_master_database_enriched.csv`).
- `[x]` **Install Alchemical Tools:** Arm the environment with `pulp`, the linear programming library necessary for optimization.

## ✅ PHASE 1: THE PULP-POWERED CHIMERA (Completed & Archived)

### 1.1: Core Optimizer v1 (Proof of Concept - "The Naive God")
- `[x]` **BREADCRUMB:** Successfully proved the core optimization logic but revealed the tactical necessity of a bench.

### 1.2: Strategic Core Optimizer v2 & v3 (The "Thrifty God" Ascension)
- `[x]` **BREADCRUMB:** Successfully evolved the Chimera to understand the Starter/Bench duality and to be ruthlessly cost-efficient, forging our perfected baseline model.

### 1.3: Arming the Chimera (Tactical Scenario Engine)
- `[x]` **BREADCRUMB:** The simulations were a monumental success but revealed the Chimera's final, critical flaw: "Captaincy Blindness."

### 1.4: Granting Sight (The Captaincy Coefficient)
- `[x]` **Create `enrich_with_insight.py`** to inject our `(π)` strategic knowledge.
- `[x]` **Define the "Captaincy Coefficient"** and create the `Prophetic_Points` (`PP`) metric.
- `[x]` **Create `chimera_prophet.py`** to utilize the new metric.
- `[x]` **BREADCRUMB:** The Prophet Chimera correctly placed Salah in the starting XI, proving the value of `PP`.

---

## ✅ PHASE 1.5: REALITY RECONCILIATION (Completed)

- `[x]` **Acknowledge Personal History:** Create `squad.csv` to track our actual squad and purchase prices.
- `[x]` **Forge the Reality Bender:** Create `update_prices.py` script to inject our purchase prices into the market data, ensuring our budget is calculated against *our* reality, not the market's.
- `[x]` **Update Workflow:** Integrate this as a new, mandatory pre-processing step before running the main gauntlet.

---

## ✅ PHASE 2: THE PYOMO ASCENSION (Completed)

Having reached the limits of `pulp`'s expressive power, we have completed a full heart transplant. We have re-forged our solver engine using the more powerful and flexible `pyomo` framework, unlocking new levels of strategic complexity and future potential.

### 2.1: Arming the Forge (Pre-Op)
- `[x]` **Install `pyomo` Framework:** `uv pip install pyomo`.
- `[x]` **Install `glpk` Solver:** `sudo apt-get install -y glpk-utils`.

### 2.2: The Heart Transplant (v1 - The Superior God)
- `[x]` **Create the New Grimoire:** `chimera_pyomo_v1.py`.
- `[x]` **Translate the Model:** Successfully re-wrote the "Thrifty God" logic from our final `pulp` script into `pyomo` syntax.
- `[x]` **Verify SUPERIORITY, Not Parity:** The `v1` Pyomo/GLPK engine surpassed the pulp/CBC output.
- `[x]` **BREADCRUMB:** The `v1` engine, while more powerful, revealed a philosophical blind spot in choosing between bench players of identical cost but different potential.

### 2.3: The Final Apotheosis (v2 - The Bench Potency Epsilon)
- `[x]` **Create the Ultimate Grimoire:** `chimera_pyomo_v2.py`.
- `[x]` **Evolve the Prime Directive:** Modified the `pyomo` objective function to include the "Bench Potency Epsilon."
- `[x]` **Verify the Final Wisdom:** Confirmed that the `v2` script now makes the strategically correct choice for the bench.

### 2.4: The Commander's New Orders
- `[x]` **Perform the `commander.py` Transplant:** Refactored `commander.py` to orchestrate the full pipeline, including the dual-solver reality.
- `[x]` **Update Documentation:** Updated `README.md` to reflect the final dependencies and the new, perfected master script.

---

## 🔴 PHASE 3: THE COMMAND DECK (Current Objective)

The final phase: building the elegant, powerful, and interactive command center from which we will wield the Chimera's power.

### 3.1: Forge the Scepter (Master Orchestration Script)

- `[x]` **Create `commander.py`:** A single, top-level script that orchestrates the entire data pipeline.
- `[x]` **Refactor Core Scripts:** Ensure all pipeline scripts are importable and can be commanded.
- `[x]` **Add "Stage 0" Auto-Cleaning:** The Commander now purges old database files before each run.
- `[x]` **Add "Stage 6" Auto-Scribing:** The Commander now captures solver outputs and saves them to `squad_prophecy.md`.
- `[x]` **BREADCRUMB:** The Scepter is forged and powerful. We have a "one script to rule them all," but it is not yet a true, flexible Command Deck.

### 3.2: Build the Throne (Full CLI Implementation)

- `[x]` **Choose a Framework:** `click` has been chosen for its power and elegance.
- `[x]` **Create the `bamf` CLI:** The `bamf.py` script is our new entry point.
  - `[x]` `run-gauntlet`: The primary command is forged and functional.
  - `[ ]` `run-scenario`: An interactive command to run "what-if" simulations with flags for including/excluding players.
  - `[ ]` `audit`: Sub-commands for auditing team names, player names, etc.
  - `[ ]` `init`: A helper command to create the new gameweek vault.
