# PROJECT: BAMF DOMINATOR - OPERATIONAL GRIMOIRE (v2.0)

<!-- Placeholder for our glorious crest -->

## MISSION STATEMENT

To systematically dismantle and dominate the Fantasy Premier League simulation by transforming raw, chaotic data into a decisive strategic advantage. This project is the home of the **Chimera**, a Python-based squad optimization engine that evolves from a simple data processor into a time-aware, prophetically-guided **Oracle**. Our motto: **EX DATA, VICTORIA** (From Data, Victory).

## THE WEEKLY RITUAL: From Data to Dominance

This is the precise, non-negotiable workflow to be executed at the start of each new Gameweek. The order is critical. Each step feeds the next.

### Step 1: The Gathering (Manual Data Update)

The Oracle is omniscient, but it cannot see data that does not yet exist. Before any incantations can be cast, you, the `(π)` Pirate, must provide the weekly sacrifice of fresh intelligence. The following CSV files **MUST BE MANUALLY UPDATED** each week with the latest information:

- **Player Data CSVs:**

  - `goalkeepers.csv`
  - `defenders.csv`
  - `midfielders.csv`
  - `forwards.csv`
    > **ACTION:** Update these files with the latest **Price** and **Total Points (TP)** for all players. This is the historical record of what has been.

- **Fixture Data CSV:**
  - `fixtures.csv`
    > **ACTION:** Create a new file for the upcoming 5-Gameweek horizon. Update it with the new opponents, locations (Home/Away), and your assessed Fixture Difficulty Rating (FDR) based on the color-coding. This is the prophecy of what is to come.

### Step 2: The Forging (Automated Script Execution)

Once the raw intelligence has been gathered, you must execute the following Python scripts **IN THIS EXACT ORDER**. Each script is an incantation that builds upon the last, culminating in the forging of the ultimate squad.

1.  **`python forge_cauldron.py`**

    - **Purpose:** The first forging. It takes the four updated player CSVs and smelts them into a single, unified master database (`fpl_master_database_enriched.csv`).

2.  **`python enrich_with_insight.py`**

    - **Purpose:** The transfusion of soul. It takes the master database and injects our strategic `(π)` knowledge, creating the "Captaincy Coefficient" and the `Prophetic_Points` metric. This forges the `fpl_master_database_prophetic.csv`.

3.  **`python grand_synthesis.py`**

    - **Purpose:** The merging of realities. It takes the prophetic player data and fuses it with the new fixture data, calculating the `FDR_Horizon` and the ultimate `Projected_Score`. This forges the final `fpl_master_database_OMNISCIENT.csv`.

4.  **`python chimera_oracle.py`**
    - **Purpose:** The final prophecy. This is the master script. It consumes the Omniscient Database and unleashes the Oracle Chimera to solve for the single, mathematically optimal squad for the upcoming 5-Gameweek period. This is your final answer.

## THE ARSENAL: FILE MANIFEST

A breakdown of the critical components of our war machine.

### Python Scripts (The Grimoires)

- `forge_cauldron.py`: Unifies the four raw player data files.
- `enrich_with_insight.py`: Injects captaincy coefficients to create the prophetic database.
- `grand_synthesis.py`: Merges player and fixture data to create the omniscient database.
- `chimera_oracle.py`: The master optimizer. Consumes the omniscient data to forge the final team.
- `chimera_scenarios.py`: A tactical workbench for running "what-if" scenarios (e.g., forcing player inclusions).

### CSV Files (The Artifacts)

- **INPUT ARTIFACTS (UPDATE WEEKLY):**
  - `goalkeepers.csv`
  - `defenders.csv`
  - `midfielders.csv`
  - `forwards.csv`
  - `fixtures_gwX-gwY.csv`
- **OUTPUT ARTIFACTS (Generated by Scripts):**
  - `fpl_master_database_enriched.csv`
  - `fpl_master_database_prophetic.csv`
  - `fpl_master_database_OMNISCIENT.csv` (The most powerful artifact)

### Brainlet: The Stereoscopic Lens

`!BRAINLET The Stereoscopic Lens` (v1.1 Update)

**Core Concept:** A protocol for achieving true analytical depth perception by synthesizing two disparate forms of intelligence: the quantitative, statistical reality provided by the Oracle (`⁂` Data) and the qualitative, narrative reality provided by human-generated intel (`π` Data). It allows us to navigate the "waking dream" of an FPL Gameweek not as a flat, 2D map, but as a rich, textured, 3D landscape.

**Limitation/Blindness Addressed:** This Brainlet simultaneously corrects for two critical forms of cognitive blindness:

1.  **Quantitative Myopia:** The `⁂` Oracle's blindness to unquantifiable "soft factors" like team morale, tactical synergy, player psychology, and manager pressure. It sees the numbers, but not the weather.
2.  **Narrative Bias:** The `π` Pundit's blindness to the vast statistical landscape, making it susceptible to recency bias, emotional reasoning, and compelling storylines that lack a robust mathematical foundation.

**Mechanism/Application & Perspective Change:**

- **Mechanism:** The protocol is executed by first establishing the hard statistical baseline (the `⁂` FDR list), which acts as the "left eye's view." Then, the narrative intel (the `π` analysis) is overlaid as the "right eye's view." The user then consciously compares the two views using the standardized operational template below, looking for areas of confirmation, contradiction, and contextual nuance.
- **Perspective Change:** The fundamental shift is from viewing the Oracle's FDR as an _absolute truth_ to viewing it as a _heavily-qualified baseline_. It transforms the user from a passive recipient of prophecy into an active interpreter and prophet. The core question evolves from "What is the FDR?" to "The baseline FDR is X, _but what does the narrative tell us about the nature of X in this specific context?_"

### Operational Template (The Gauntlet v1.0)

_(To be used weekly for key fixtures)_

```markdown
#### **Fixture: [Home Team] (H) vs. [Away Team] (A)**

- **`⁂` Readout:** [Home Team] FDR: **[FDR]** | [Away Team] FDR: **[FDR]**
- **`π` Dispatch:** [Key quotes or summary of the narrative intelligence regarding this specific fixture.]
- **Verdict:** [Choose one: NO ADJUSTMENT (CONFIRMED) | ADJUSTMENT WARRANTED (UPGRADE/DOWNGRADE) | ADD VOLATILITY FLAG]. [Your analysis of the discrepancy or confirmation, and the proposed 'true feeling' of the FDR if adjusted.]
```

**Contribution to Architecture/Emergence:**

- This Brainlet is the primary operational mechanism of the **`π-⁂` Bridge**, transforming a theoretical concept into a repeatable, weekly analytical ritual.
- It serves as the foundational intelligence-gathering step for **The Prophet's Gambit (Captaincy Protocol v1.0)**, ensuring high-leverage decisions are made with maximum available intelligence.
- It creates a crucial feedback loop. By documenting the Stereoscopic analysis and comparing it to post-Gameweek results, we can train ourselves—and eventually, the Oracle—to better weigh narrative factors, allowing our collective intelligence to emerge and evolve `(⇌)`.

**Examples:**

- **Confirmation:** The `⁂` FDR for Man City vs. Burnley was 1, and the `π` narrative confirmed it was the most dominant "1" imaginable, solidifying a captaincy choice.
- **Contradiction:** The `⁂` FDR for Aston Villa was favorable (2), but the `π` narrative of "staleness" revealed this number to be a statistical lie, flagging the team as a potential trap.
- **Nuance:** The `⁂` FDR for Liverpool vs. Crystal Palace was favorable (2), but the `π` narrative of two unbeaten, in-form teams corrected this, revealing the fixture to be far more challenging than the historical data suggested.
